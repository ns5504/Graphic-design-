# Graphic-design-
As part of my Visual Arts minor, I’ve completed a range of design and development projects that blend creativity with user-focused functionality. Here are a few highlights:

🖼️ Graphic Design Projects
NS_Archive – A digital exhibition experience created for gallery display. This project combined layout design, typography, and color theory to create a compelling visual archive.

Event Posters & Campaigns – Designed cohesive branding and visual identity systems for mock events, focusing on hierarchy, composition, and audience impact.

🌐 Interactive Web Design Projects
BEFOREIGO – A travel checklist site where the homepage has a professional tone and each country page is illustrated with playful, cartoon-style elements.

NS_Bucketlist – A responsive web platform to track places to visit, styled with a clean UI and interactive hover effect
